                        I've worked on many different projects, in both contract and permanent
                        roles. My favourite languages to work in are Python and JavaScript.

                        I love helping Junior Developers grow and develop their skills. In
                        particular I am dedicated to helping women to find their place in tech, and
                        have helped many women learn how to code and to get into the tech industry.

                        One day I will own a fleet of tiny dogs. For now, I make do by petsitting
                        wherever possible. This cutie is Izzy, a Miniature Schnauzer who eats like a
                        Great Dane.
