                        Gather is on a mission to increase the uptake of the Computer Science subject in high schools. Our strategy is to take workshops around the country at different high schools, for teachers and for students. In my role as a presenter for the Python workshops, I work with both students and teachers to grow their appreciation for programming and its place in the curriculum.

Kiwi Foo was a great way to connect with other people who are passionate about research and making a positive impact on our society, it provided new motivation to keep up with my CS outreach work!

                        Recently I attended an education themed Start Up Weekend in Wellington. This was a fantastic experience, in less than 48 hours our team of only 4 designed a business and a prototype for our product.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our team's business idea was a Mobile Audience Response system, or a "MARS". Our application's name? Rover. Rover is a web app designed to increase student engagement, targetted at university lectures, but also suitable for high school classrooms. It works by allowing the teacher to ask the students questions via their laptops and/or mobile devices, and they can then see the response in real time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Behind Rover is a PHP framework, along with SQL, HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript code, which can be viewed <a href="https://hayleyavw@bitbucket.org/tanyagray/engageme.git" target="_blank">here.</a>

                        I came 3rd place in a competition sponsored by Google and Netsafe, for which I created an Internet Safety campaign. This involved making a video, and giving presentations to different schools, teachers, and parents in my region.
