                At eResearch 2015 I gave a presentation on the topic of "Visualising Network Data." This was based around the the WebGL project mentioned further down the page.

                <p>
                    I recently worked on a data visualisation project for a networking company here in New Zealand. This involved creating a 3D representation of their network by overlaying network data onto a model of New Zealand. This was done using Three.js, a library for JavaScript that runs on top of WebGL.

                    A demo of the 3D point cloud of NZ can be seen <a href="{{ url_for('NZ') }}">here</a>. (Press 'c' to watch the animation).
                    If the link does not work (give it a few seconds...), try it in Chrome (the web browser with the most WebGL support).

                <p>
                    Recently I attended an education themed Start Up Weekend in Wellington. This was a fantastic experience, in less than 48 hours our team of only 4 designed a business and a prototype for our product.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our team's business idea was a Mobile Audience Response system, or a "MARS". Our application's name? Rover. Rover is a web app designed to increase student engagement, targetted at university lectures, but also suitable for high school classrooms. It works by allowing the teacher to ask the students questions via their laptops and/or mobile devices, and they can then see the response in real time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Behind Rover is a PHP framework, along with SQL, HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript code, which can be viewed <a href="https://hayleyavw@bitbucket.org/tanyagray/engageme.git" target="_blank">here.</a>

                <p>
                    Gather is on a mission to increase the uptake of the Computer Science subject in high schools. Our strategy is to take workshops around the country at different high schools, for teachers and for students. In my role as a presenter for the Python workshops, I work with both students and teachers to grow their appreciation for programming and its place in the curriculum.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gather is an industry funded operation, so if you think you can help us out please <a href="contactform">contact me.</a>

                    This was created by a team of about 15 students, along with 5 teachers and tutors at the NCSS Summer School, in less than 10 days. My role was to create and maintain the tornado server, while other team members were working on the database management, styling, template engine etc.
