                        <p>
                            I am currently a Software Developer in Perth, Australia, although my roots
                            lie as a kiwi from Palmerston North, New Zealand.
                            I have worked at prestigious companies in a variety of roles, such as Google, the
                            University of Canterbury, Seven West Media, SheCodes and more.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am also an evangelist for Women in Tech and have had extensive experience in writing
                            educational resources and teaching workshops about Computer Science and Programming for all
                            ages and experience levels.
                            My ability to describe technical details in a simple manner certainly sets me apart from
                            others in my field and makes me an asset to any team.

                                Their vision is to increase diversity in tech by inspiring 100,000 women across
                                Australia by 2025.</p>
                            <p>I was the Lead Mentor the first Plus and Flash programs, and continue to work in a
                                support role helping to ensure the programs run smoothly.</p>
                            <p>Plus is a 6 month part time course designed to help women transition into tech careers.
                                I taught the first three months of the course where the students learned HTML, CSS,
                                Python and Django, and continued on as a coordinator for the second half of the course.
                            </p>
                            <p>Flash is a one week program designed to give women a taster of several different areas of
                                tech, including Web Development, Python, Flask, Data and Algorithms. I developed
                                the content for each of these topics and was the lead mentor for the first Flash
                                program.</p>

                            <p>The Computer Science Field Guide is an interactive textbook used in schools around the
                                world to teach students about Computer Science concepts. I worked on this project
                                part time for four and a half years. Most of my time was spent developing what are
                                called “interactives.” These are little JavaScript applets that aim to teach Computer
                                Science concepts by reinforcing the material in the chapter in a fun and engaging way.
                                I also made considerable contributions as an editor and author to a number of
                                chapters.</p>
                            <p>I worked on many of these interactives, but perhaps most significant interactives
                                I created were for the Computer Graphics chapter. The Box Translation and Rotation
                                interactives demonstrate the basic principles of moving objects in 3D space. They are
                                written using Three.js, a JavaScript framework for WebGL. The Arrow Manipulation
                                interactives demonstrate how matrices can be used to manipulate shapes in 2D space, all
                                written in JavaScript.</p>
                            <p>The CS Field Guide is an open source project so you can take a look at my
                                contributions (and even contribute yourself) by checking out the repository on Github.

                            <p>If you have ever enrolled at a University then you will know that it is not an easy task,
                                and in fact once you’ve navigated your way through it you feel like you’ve already
                                earned some kind of qualification. The University of Canterbury used to receive
                                thousands of calls every year from prospective engineering students asking for help with
                                their enrolment as it is a surprisingly complicated task given the number of
                                requirements for each course (which is also affected by the type of qualification earned
                                in high school), and the number of specialisations on offer.</p>
                            <p>I was asked to create a web page to help make this application process easier for
                                new students. This has been embedded in the Engineering at UC website since 2016 and was
                                a remarkable success that saves university enrolment and student help staff hours of
                                work every year.</p>

                            <p>In summer 2015/16 I was an intern on the Bandwidth Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)
                                team at Google.To best describe what an SRE does, think about the last time Google went
                                down, can you even think of a time Google was down? Probably not too many memories
                                spring to mind, and that is because SREs are working around the clock to keep everything
                                up and running, and to fix things when something does go wrong.</p>
                            <p>As an intern on Bandwidth SRE, another intern and I partnered to create an internal
                                tool to be used by other SRE teams to check the status of the amount of bandwidth their
                                service (e.g. Maps, Drive, YouTube, etc) in Google is using. The tool proved to be
                                extremely useful and was already being used before they even finished the internship!

                            <p>This was my first internship. I started at REANNZ only a week and a half after
                                my last exam at high school, and it was a great way to spend the summer before starting
                                university.</p>
                            <p>At REANNZ I worked on a data visualisation project, which involved creating a 3D
                                representation of the REANNZ network by overlaying network data onto a model of New
                                Zealand. This was done using Three.js, a JavaScript framework for WebGL, as well as some
                                Python scripts for cleaning and sorting the data.</p>

                            <p>The National Computer Science School runs a summer camp program, which I attended as
                                a student in 2014 and 2015, an industry mentor in 2016, and a tutor in 2017 and 2018.
                                NCSS is what made me realise that I wanted a career in Software! It is a 10 day event
                                where students from all over Australia and New Zealand, as well as tutors from all over
                                the world, come together to learn and experience Computer Science. It's just as nerdy as
                                it sounds and is always an incredible experience!</p>
