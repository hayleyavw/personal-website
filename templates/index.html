                            Hayley van Waas is currently a Software Developer in Perth, Australia, although her roots
                            lie as a kiwi from Palmerston North, New Zealand.
                            She has worked at prestigious companies in a variety of roles, such as Google, the
                            University of Canterbury, Seven West Media, SheCodes and more.
                        </p>

                            Hayley is also an evangelist for Women in Tech and has had extensive experience in writing
                            educational resources and teaching workshops about Computer Science and Programming for all
                            ages and experience levels.
                            Her ability to describe technical details in a simple manner certainly sets her apart from
                            others in her field and makes her an asset to any team.

                                Have you noticed how recipe websites always seem to have someone’s life story before the

                                engineering students asking for help with their enrolment as it is a surprisingly
                                complicated task given the number of requirements for each course (which is also
                                affected by the type of High School Qualification earned), and the number of
                                specialisations on offer.

                                In summer 2015/16 I was a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) Intern at Google.
                                I was with one other intern on the Bandwidth SRE team.
                                To best describe what an SRE does, think about the last time Google went down, can you
                                even think of a time Google was down?
                                Probably not too many memories spring to mind, and that is because SREs are working
                                around the clock to keep everything up and running, and to fix things when something
                                does go wrong.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As an intern on Bandwidth SRE, myself and my intern partner created an internal tool to
                                be used by other SREs to check the status of the amount of bandwidth their service (e.g.
                                Maps, Drive, YouTube, etc) in Google is using.
                                The tool proved to be extremely useful and was already being used before we even
                                finished the internship!

                                This was my first internship.
                                I started at REANNZ only a week and a half after my last exam at high school, and it was
                                a great way to spend the summer before starting my first year at University!

                                I worked on a data visualisation project, which involved creating a 3D representation of
                                the REANNZ network by overlaying network data onto a model of New Zealand.
                                This was done using Three.js, a JavaScript framework for WebGL, as well as some Python
                                scripts for cleaning and sorting the data.

                                The National Computer Science School runs a summer camp program, which I attended as a
                                student in 2014 and 2015, an industry mentor in 2016, and a tutor in 2017 and 2018.
                                NCSS is what made me realise that I wanted a career in Software!
                                It is a 10 day event where students from all over Australia and New Zealand, and tutors
                                from all over the world, come together to learn and experience Computer Science.
                                It's just as nerdy as it sounds and is always an incredible experience!

                                From during my last year of High School to my second year of University I presented and
                                mentored many Gather Workshops.
                                Although I’m quite biased towards Python, I have been found presenting/mentoring
                                Robotics and JavaScript workshops on several occasions.
