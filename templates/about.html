                <p>
                    I have been programming for a few years now and have experience in Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, PHP, Java... My first language was Python and it is still my preferred language, although I also enjoy working with JavaScript.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Below is a brief description of my work, if you would like to view my official R&eacutesum&eacute, please <a href="contactform">contact me.</a>
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="radius panel">
                <h3>My skills...<hr/></h3>
                <h4>Version Control</h4>
                <p>
                    Never will I work without a version control system again. These days I work with Git for all my projects, and will never go back.
                </p>
                <h4>Front-End Web Development</h4>
                <p>
                     A large proportion of my work these days falls into this category. As a result, I have become very familiar with HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript.
                </p>
                <h4>Back-End Development</h4>
                <p>
                    This is probably my preferred area of programming, tying together an app and its database in a logical way is always a challenge that I enjoy working through.
                </p>
                <h4>Databases</h4>
                <p>
                    I am very familiar with both MySQL and SQLite. I've mostly worked with SQLite because I love the simplicity, it is so easy to get up and and running quickly.
                </p>

                <h3>What I want to learn...<hr/></h3>
                <h4>Data Visualisation</h4>
                <p>
                    This is an area I have recently started exploring, having only recently completed a project using WebGL through the Three.js library for JavaScript. I hope to gain more experience in projects of this kind over the next few months.
                </p>
                <h4>Mobile App Development</h4>
                <p>
                    Recently I started delving into app development, and created an Android app. Java was a tough language to break into, and although I completed the app up to a standard I was happy to publish, I still have a lot to learn.
                </p>
                <h4>Django</h4>
                <p>
                    After using Flask for this website I have discovered the potential of a framework to make development so much easier. There are plenty of these out there, and since Django seems to be one of the most popular python frameworks, I'm keen to try it out.
                </p>

                <h4>Teaching and Public Speaking</h4>
                <p>
                    Teaching programming is something I absolutely love doing! I have taught plenty of different topics to a variety of age groups, primarily as a presenter for Gather Workhops.

                <h3>When I'm not doing computer stuff...<hr/></h3>
                <p>
                   Occassionally I decide it's time to find another hobby; the current phase includes skateboarding and nail art.
