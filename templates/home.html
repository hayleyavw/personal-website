            About Me
        </h2>
        <p>
            My name is Hayley, and I am a programmer.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have been programming for a few years now and have worked in Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript/jQuery, SQL, PHP and Java. My first language was Python, and is still my preferred language - although I will admit, HTML/CSS is growing on me.
        </p>
        <p>
            Below is a brief description of my work, if you would like to view my official CV, please do not hesitate to <a href="contactform">contact me.</a>
        </p>

        <h3>My skills...</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4>Version Control</h4>
                <p>
                    Never will I work without a version control system again. I work with Git for all my projects now and will never go back.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Front-End Web Development</h4>
                <p>
                    This includes HTML5 and CSS3 obviously, and I have recently started working with SASS and Compass, I don't know why I didn't start using them earlier. Also I have used a little bit of jQuery of late as well, easy framework to icorporate into a site.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Back-End Development</h4>
                <p>
                    Or 'logic programming' as I prefer to call it. This is the kind of programming I like best.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Databases</h4>
                <p>
                    Databases weren't my preferred area of computer science for a long time, but I am finally starting to see their potential. Although I wouldn't yet call myself an expert, I have mastered the basics of SQLite and MySQL.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><h4>Teaching</h4>
                <p>
                    Teaching programming is something I absolutely love doing. I have been involved with teaching Python for a few months now and I find it be very rewarding work.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What I want to learn...</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4>Mobile App Development</h4>
                <p>
                    I am gradually easing into a mobile app development project, but there is still so much to learn. I am starting with Java for an Android app, Java is a tough language to break into I've found, but so far it's going alright.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Frameworks</h4>
                <p>
                    There are so many of these out there, after being involved in a project where we had to make our own PHP framework, I have decided it's time I learnt how to user more frameworks. This site was actually built on Flask, a Python framework, but there are many more to explore.
        </ul>
