            About Me
        </h2>
        <p>
            My name is Hayley, and I am a programmer.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have been programming for a few years now and have worked in Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript/jQuery, SQL, PHP and Java. My first language was Python, and is still my preferred language - although I will admit, HTML/CSS is growing on me.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>My skills...</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4>Version Control</h4>
                <p>
                    Never will I work without a version control system again. I work with Git for all my projects now and will never go back.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><h4>Front-end Web Development</h4>
                <p>
                    HTML5 and CSS3 obviously, and recently started working with SASS and Compass, I don't know why I didn't start using them earlier. Used a little bit of jQuery of late as well, easy framework to icorporate into a site.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><h4>Databases</h4>
                <p>
                    Databases weren't my preferred area of computer science for a long time, but I am finally starting to see their potential. Worked with both SQLite and MySQL, although I wouldn't yet call myself an expert, I have mastered the basics.
                    DOES PHP GO HERE
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><h4>Teaching</h4>
                <p>
                    Teaching programming is something I absolutely love doing. I have been involved with a couple of Python workshops, but most of my experience has been one-on-one.
                </p>

        </ul>

        <h3>What I want to learn...</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>Mobile Development</h4>
                    <p>
                        I am gradually easing into a mobile app development project, but there is still so much to learn. I am starting with Java for an Android app, Java is a tough language to break into.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
