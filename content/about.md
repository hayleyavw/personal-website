I am a kiwi software developer and am always in search of the next project!

The projects I enjoy the most are those in the field of Computer Science education in schools. It took until my second to last year of high school before I finally considered software engineering as a viable career path. School is where you should be exposed to as many industries as possible, so that you can figure out what it is that interests you. I don't know what it is about software engineering and computer science that makes it such a well kept secret from schools, it's a fun, rewarding and challenging area to work in and it is a shame that so many kids wont get to experience it, which is why I think outreach work is so important.

I am passionate about my work, and I love to be challenged! I love to take on projects that are well over my head and be surrounded by engineers more experienced than myself because that is where I learn the most.

When I am not working, I enjoy public speaking and teaching programming and therefore dedicate a lot of time to volunteering for organisations and/or at events. Outside of academia and tech, I like to keep fit by running 2-4 times a week and attending pilates classes at the gym. When I really need to relax I can often be found watching comedies on Netflix or painting my nails.
