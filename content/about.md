I am a junior developer, and am always in search of the next project.

The projects I enjoy the most are those it the field of  Computer Science education in schools as I think this is really important. I also like to be challenged. I like to take on projects that are well over my head and be surrounded in engineers more experienced than myself because that is where I learn the most. I am not afraid to speak up and have my say when it comes to making design decisions and ask a lot of questions if I don't understand something.

When I am not working, I love public speaking and teaching programming and therefore dedicate a lot of time to volunteering for organisations and/or at events. Outside of academia and tech, I like to keep fit by running 2-4 times a week and attending pilates classes at the gym. When I really need to relax I can often be found watching comedies on Netflix or painting my nails.
